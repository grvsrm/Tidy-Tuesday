# Tidy-Tuesday
Tidy Data Exploration using Tidyverse and Tidymodels on various datasets released by R4DS community every Tuesday. These datasets are released by r4datascience community on their official github repo [R4DS](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on every tuesday. This is a commendable efforts by the R community. R community across the world enthusiastically participates in exploring these datasets and comes up with something new everytime by individual submissions that benefits the whole community a lot. This repo is my take on these datasets. I primarily use tidyversse and tidymodels ecosystem to explore these datasets.

Mostly, the code for each datasets is in R scripts. The naming conventions for R scripts goes by the date, a particular dataset was realeased on. Whenever, I feel a need to communicate my findings to others, I use rmarkdown scripts and upload it on my [personal website](https://gauravsharma.netlify.app/).

Feel free to access this repository. I will be happy, if my work helps you in learning something new. Thanks for your time..!
